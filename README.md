# WEB102 Prework - Sea Monster Crowdfunding

Submitted by: Dave Boku

Sea Monster Crowdfunding is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 6-8 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Implemented a search feature that allows users to look up any game. Results would be displayed on a separate search page. 
* [ ] Overhaul of the design of the website. Implemented lighter colors and established a consistent color layout throughout the website.
* [ ] Future work would include making the search system more efficient through the use of more efficient data storage and search systems.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I wanted to implement a search feature that was dynamic and would redirect users to a separate search page. I did not know how to implement it, so I went online to look for similar implementations. However, when adapting the implementations I encountered various issues which I wasn't able to debug. The final search product you see is by no means perfect. However, through iterative changes to the code and logic, I was able to get the final product I wanted.
